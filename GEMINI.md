# Cozy Focus Dashboard Project Context

## Project Goal
A personalized, aesthetically pleasing web dashboard for focus and productivity, featuring a customizable timer, to-do list, calendar, and dynamic background.

## Current Status
- Fully functional web application with:
    - Clock, Date, Greeting, Weather.
    - Countdown Timer with task integration.
    - To-Do List with persistence.
    - Focus History (Calendar) with session tracking.
    - Dynamic Quotes.
    - Custom wallpaper selection (presets & upload).
- **Latest Fixes**: UI centering, clock size, To-Do Enter key, local quotes implemented.

## Pending Tasks / Next Steps
1.  **Create GitHub Repository**: Initialize a Git repository for *only this project* (`DevStudio/FocusTimer`).
2.  **Dynamic UI Colors**: Implement logic to adjust UI element colors (e.g., accent color) based on the dominant colors of the selected background image.
3.  **Adjust Translucency**: Increase translucency of glassmorphism widgets slightly (`--glass-bg` and `--glass-border` in `style.css`) for better wallpaper visibility while maintaining readability.

## Tech Stack
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
- APIs: Open-Meteo for weather, Browser Geolocation.
- Local Storage for persistence.

## Roadmap
1. [ ] Implement dynamic UI color adjustment based on wallpaper.
2. [ ] Adjust widget translucency.
3. [ ] Create a GitHub repository for this project.
4. [ ] Further refine UI/UX as needed.
